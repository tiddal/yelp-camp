## Side Notes:

I don't pretend to keep working on this project although I think it should be refactored to use the new ES8 and ES9 syntax.

Additionaly, some more features could be added like searching, chating and likes!

The app runs without errors but is poorly documented. It's up and running on <a href="https://polar-sea-05769.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>!
